## Professional
> I'm a Medical Doctor specialising in **Genetic and Genomic Medicine**. I'm Deputy Chief Clinical Information Officer for our Trust, and part of a great team working to implement the **encompass** project across Northern Ireland - a region-wide Electronic Health Record that will transform the delivery of care.

## Personal
> Living in Northern Ireland, walking a beagle, riding a bike.
> I have a longstanding connection with the wonderful Nazareth EMMS Hospital in northern Israel, and am a veteran of several Nazareth Challenge bike rides to raise money for the [Nazareth Trust](https://www.nazarethtrust.org/nazareth-challenge/).

## Languages
* I'm learning [Arabic](https://github.com/shanemuk/shanemuk.github.io/blob/main/arabic.md) - it's taking a while, but it is a beautiful language and I'm enjoying finding out more.
* I have a smattering of French and German, and am working on-and-off on Hebrew.
* I strongly recommend [LingQ.com](https://lingq.com) as a solid method to gain skills in a language by *listening*, rather than by learning grammar, and of course you can consolidate this by listening to your chosen language material on YouTube, podcasts etc. I'm afraid Duolingo does **not** work for me.
